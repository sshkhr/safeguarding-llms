## Introduction

In this workshop, we will explore practical applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) and discuss strategies for generating structured outputs, ensuring topical relevance, preventing hallucinations, avoiding data leakage, and installing safety guardrails on third-party applications accessed by LLMs.

## Installation

### Local Machine

To run the code on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/workshop-llm-safeguarding.git

2. **Install the required packages:**

    Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then, run:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the demo notebook:**

    Start Jupyter Notebook and open `demo.ipynb`:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    Open `demo.ipynb` and run the cells to follow along with the workshop.

### Google Colab

You can also run the code in Google Colab. Follow these steps:

1. **Open the repository in Colab:**
